  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t remember the exact moment it started.
    But I remember how everything felt different after you.
    Conversations lasted longer.
    Silence felt warmer.
    And suddenly, the world didn’t feel so heavy anymore.

  <h2>What We Became</h2>
  <p>
    We weren’t perfect.  
    We fought.  
    We misunderstood.  
    We hurt each other sometimes.  
    But even on the worst days…  
    choosing you felt easier than letting you go.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Distance</h2>
  <p>
    Distance tested us.
    Nights felt longer.
    Screens replaced touch.
    But love didn’t shrink — it evolved.
    It learned patience.
    It learned trust.
    It learned to survive.
  </p>

<section class="section highlight">
  <h2>You Are My Safe Place</h2>
  <p>
    In a world that constantly moves,
    you are where I pause.
    Where I breathe.
    Where I feel understood
    without explaining myself.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section dark">
  <h2>No Matter What</h2>
  <p>
    Even if we change.
    Even if life pulls us in different directions.
    Even if things get messy again.
    I’d still choose you.
    Every single time.
  </p>

  <h2>One Last Thing</h2>
  <p id="secret">
    If you are reading this…
    just know —
    you are loved more than words,
    more than distance,
    more than time.
