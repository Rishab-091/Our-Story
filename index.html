  <h2>Before You</h2>
  <p>
    Before you, life was moving but it wasn’t living.
    Days passed, nights ended, everything felt routine.
    I was existing, not feeling.
    Something was missing — and I didn’t even know what.
  </p>

<section class="section dark">
  <h2>When You Came In</h2>
  <p>
    You didn’t change things loudly.
    You changed them gently.
    Slowly.
    Quietly.
    And suddenly, everything felt warmer.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>The Little Moments</h2>
  <p>
    The late conversations.
    The random smiles.
    The comfort of knowing you’re there.
    These are the moments I never want to forget.
  </p>

<section class="section dark">
  <h2>What You Mean To Me</h2>
  <p>
    You are not just someone I love.
    You are someone I trust.
    Someone I choose.
    Someone who feels like peace in a noisy world.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>When Things Aren’t Easy</h2>
  <p>
    I won’t promise perfection.
    I won’t promise no fights.
    But I promise honesty.
    Effort.
    And staying — even when it’s hard.
  </p>

<section class="section dark">
  <h2>You Are Home</h2>
  <p>
    No matter where life takes us,
    no matter how far or difficult things get,
    you will always feel like home to me.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t know what tomorrow holds.
    But if you’re there,
    I know I’ll be okay.
    That’s all I need.
  </p>

<section class="section dark">
  <h2>This Is Only The Beginning</h2>
  <p>
    This isn’t the end of the story.
    This is just one chapter.
    And if I’m lucky,
    I’ll get to write the rest with you.
